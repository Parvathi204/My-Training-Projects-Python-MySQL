📘 Project 1 – Student Management System (Python + MySQL)

This project is a Python-based Student Management System integrated with MySQL for storing and managing student information. The system is designed to help maintain student records efficiently, making it suitable for academic institutions, training centers, or small educational programs.

It provides a simple command-line interface that allows users to perform all essential student-related operations such as adding a new student, updating details, deleting a student, viewing all records, and searching for a specific student using either name or ID.

🔍 Features Included

✔ 1. Add New Student

Takes input for student name, age, class, and marks.

Saves the details into the MySQL database.

Ensures structured and permanent storage.

✔ 2. Update Student Details

Allows changes to any field (name, age, class, marks).

Student records can be updated through the student’s unique ID.

Helps maintain accurate and up-to-date data.

✔ 3. Delete Student Record

Permanently deletes a student using their ID.

Ensures removal of outdated or incorrect records.

✔ 4. View All Students

Displays all the students stored in the database.

Shows complete details in a structured format.

✔ 5. Search Student (By Name or ID)

Quickly locate a student using:

Student ID

Student Name

Useful for verifying student details or performing updates.

🗄 Database Integration (MySQL)

This project uses MySQL to store all student records.
The table includes the following fields:

student_id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)

name

age

class

marks

The system uses mysql-connector-python for database connectivity.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this system is to:

Maintain student data in one place

Reduce manual record-keeping errors

Retrieve and manage records efficiently
